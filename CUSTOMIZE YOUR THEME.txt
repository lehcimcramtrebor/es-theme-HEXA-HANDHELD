Move or copy "_hexaHandheldCustom" folder to 2 level parent folder just at same level then "themes" folder. (Root of SHARE partition in Batocera)
If you use Retrobat, you can move or copy to root of Retrobat folder.
Now you can customize background(s), gamelist animated logo, name displayed in gamelist transition
and tile displayed in gamelist transition.

Note after you move and customize your folder you can update theme without loosing customizations.



BACKGROUND(S) (480p file is perfect):

Place a "custom.jpg" file in backgrounds folder and this will display this image as background in all
theme.

Or place multiples files named by theme name (example: "megadrive.jpg" , "snes.jpg" etc..) and this
will display custom backgrounds by system.

Note if you use at same time a file named "custom.jpg" and a file named "snes.jpg", this will display
"custom" in all theme and only snes will be different.




GAMELIST ANIMATED LOGO (240p file is perfect):

Place a file named "custom.png" in "logo" folder and this will display your custom logo as background
animation in gamelists (only if you choose good option in theme).




NAME:

Modify the "custom.xml" file in "name" folder to display what you want on second line in gamelist
transitions.




TILE:

Create your own tile with gimp file in "HEXA-HANDHELD-GIMP-TILE.7z" archive and export as png in
"tile" folder as "custom.png", this will display your custom tile in all gamelist transitions.
